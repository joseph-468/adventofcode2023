# Advent of Code 2023

## Day 1
I found this puzzle pretty easy and thankfully didn't get stuck with phrases like oneight like other people did. I reformatted the code after completion and was pretty happy with my solution.

## Day 2
Found this a bit tricky. I realized after completing that the semicolons were completely pointless and I could just go through each line and check if each one is too large and immediately break if it is. Didn't reformat the code much afterwards as I had already butchered it.

## Day 3
I really struggled with this one and I don't know why. I had the right solution in my head but my just wasn't braining enough today to successfully code it so I couldn't complete the second part. After taking a break I came back and quickly finished it but despite that I'm not happy with my code or how long it took me.

## Day 4
I found today to be relatively easy. I'm not too happy with the code as I didn't refactor it at all or even think about performance. Part 2 took a bit of thinking to figure out how to do efficiently but I easily implemented it.

## Day 5
Today's looked quite overwhelming and difficult so I decided not to do today's but I am considering trying it at a later date.

## Day 6
The puzzle today looked very easy and was very easy. The difficulty has been all over the place so far. The hardest part of this puzzle was string handling with C++. I don't know if it's cause I haven't done it enough or what but I just couldn't get it to work.

## Day 7
I don't believe I have a particularly efficient solution today but it worked. I struggled a bit in part 2 as I hadn't read it properly and was fully replacing Js with what they were pretending to be. I got stuck beccause of this but I managed to find better test input on reddit which helped me find and quickly fix the bug.
