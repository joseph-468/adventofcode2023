# Advent of Code 2023

## Day 1
I found this puzzle pretty easy and thankfully didn't get stuck with phrases like oneight like other people did. I reformatted the code after completion and was pretty happy with my solution.

## Day 2
Found this a bit tricky. I realized after completing that the semicolons were completely pointless and I could just go through each line and check if each one is too large and immediately break if it is. Didn't reformat the code much afterwards as I had already butchered it.
